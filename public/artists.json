        "long_bio" : "<p>Cal has been creating art since they could first hold a pencil, always drawn to realism and the intricate details of portrait work. With a natural talent for capturing the unique essence of people, especially those who aren’t often represented in media, Cal’s work breathes life into every piece. After discovering a passion for abstract art, Cal transitioned from a career in nursing to tattooing, never imagining they could achieve the same level of realism in ink as on paper. Starting with neo-traditional designs, Cal gradually built the confidence to tackle portraits and fell in love with the craft all over again. Today, Cal is known for their dynamic range, spanning from neo-traditional and illustrative to abstract color and surrealism, but their heart lies in portrait and realism tattooing. With every tattoo, Cal strives to capture the depth, emotion, and story behind each subject, bringing art to life on skin.</p>",
